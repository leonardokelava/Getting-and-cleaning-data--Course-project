# Getting-and-cleaning-data--Course-project


To create your own copy of data, open the run_analysis script in R and source it. 
It will create a table with the data and store it in file "assignment.txt" which will 
be stored in your working directory. 
Then open that table by writing ext commands in  R command prompt:

>>> data <- read.table("assignment.txt", header = TRUE) 
>>>View(data)
